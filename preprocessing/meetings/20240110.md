## Meeting notes:

### Migration to LFX

- We migrated the meeting from groups.io to LFX.
- Rama reported that he didn't get a calendar invite
- Joaquin will check that the list of attendees is up-to-date

### ImageDecoder support on ONNX runtime

- We discussed during the previous meeting that the ONNX runtime team has concerns with introducing a dependency with a library such as OpenCV, due to binary size.
- We agreed to continue the discussion on this meeting but Liqun Fu could not attend, who knows more about the progress
- Joaquin will start a Github issue on ONNX runtime repository to follow this up.

### Other domains

- We have discussed earlier about expanding preprocessing to other domains.
- Currently two lines of work: NLP (Natalie) and Volumetric images (Liqun).
- Both reported that they don't have enough time to focus on those at the moment.

### Linear Algebra domain

- https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/169
- https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5821
- There is an initiative to add a linear algebra domain
- From the point of view of this group, it is OK to add new domains if this is the direction that the Operators SIG want to follow.
- Joaquin suggested to not label the domain as "pre-processing" but there's no strong opinion either way.
- To be discussed at the Operators SIG.
