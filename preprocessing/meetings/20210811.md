### Notes

* We agreed to meet monthly, Wednesday (or Tuesday-Thursday) at 5 PM CEST, to accommodate different time-zones, as we have people joining from America, Europe, and Asia.
* We agreed to use Slack as a main communication channel.
* There is a lack of standardization in data preprocessing. Different libraries are used, leading to portability issues.
* The initial goal of the group is to make data preprocessing part of ONNX and come up with a standardized set of operators that will support training and inference for a set of selected networks. The plan is to first standardize preprocessing, then incorporate it into the model.
* We see that there are existing ONNX operators that could be used to define a data preprocessing pipeline. The challenge appears with the different nature of the preprocessing pipeline. A preprocessing pipeline is typically defined on a per-sample basis, and it’s part of the data loader to assemble the preprocessed samples to a uniform batch that is then fed to the model. We don’t yet have a good idea on how the data preprocessing part can be integrated with the ONNX graph, due to its different nature.
* ONNX has no notion of batch in tensors, but the batch can be one of the dimensions. ONNX has a sequence of tensors that could be used to represent a non-uniform batch in the preprocessing pipeline.
* Data preprocessing differs from training to inference. How to incorporate that into the graph?
* Exporting to ONNX graph: Should we only support exporting TF/PyTorch/etc data pre-preprocessing to ONNX or should we also cover usage of other FWs/libraries (e.g. Pillow)?
* How will the runtime implement preprocessing? Implementations are meant to work on big tensors. We might need to define data preprocessing as functions that the runtime could optimize.

### Action items:
* **Everybody** A member of each organization to come up with a sorted list of most important networks that we would like to support initially
* **Everybody** Think about how the data processing pipeline could be represented and connected to the model
