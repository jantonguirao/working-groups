## Meeting notes:

### Status

- [IN PROGRESS] Affine grid generator operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5225
- [IN PROGRESS] Image decoder operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5294
- [MERGED] Using ONNX parser in SequenceMap tutorial - https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/pull/277

### Image decoder operator proposal

- We talked about the ImageDecoder PR
- We agreed that generated test images are enough for the purpose of our tests
- We'll need to figure out how extensive we want the test coverage to be regarding codec specific options.
- We should make opencv2 dependency optional and just fail the test if not available. Should list the dependencies only in the requirements-dev list.
- We agreed to add a note that support for lossless JPEG is optional, since it would be hard to find a suitable reference implementation.
- Channel-last (interleaved) layout is chosen. Planar layouts can be achieved via transpose. We can always add the option to support planar layouts later if needed.

## Open floor

### Operators to support different applications from MONAI

- Medical data, segmentation/classification)
- Affine grid generator. Operator currently in review.
- Sliding window inferrer is work in progress
- We discussed the possibility to introduce higher level abstractions for affine matrix generators. Joaquin pointed how it is done in NVIDIA DALI as an example: [Example](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/examples/math/geometric_transforms.html), [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/operations/nvidia.dali.fn.transforms.html)
- Several examples from MONAI could be enabled with the Affine grid generator + Sliding window inferrer.
