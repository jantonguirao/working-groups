## Meeting notes:

### Status


- [MERGED] Add Data preprocessing with ONNX: ResNet-50 example - https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/pull/266
- [MERGED] Add Resize-19: half_pixel_symmetric - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4862
- [Pending] Using ONNX parser in SequenceMap tutorial - https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/pull/277

### Next steps

- Publishing ONNX models with preprocessing
- We discussed the possibility of publishing all ResNet models augmented with the preprocessing steps. This is convenient for the user but adds a lot of overhead to maintain the models.
- After some discussion we settled on posting the preprocessing model as a separate step and add instructions for the user to combine with one of the networks.
- Additionally, we will look into adding a convenient API in onnx.hub that combines a network with a preprocessing model.
- Some of work has been also done in onnxruntime-extensions
- https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/mobile/superres.html
- https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions/blob/main/onnxruntime_extensions/tools/add_pre_post_processing_to_model.py
- Natalie will bring the topic of adding image decoding/encoding to the ONNX spec on the next meeting.
- We discussed adding a stand-alone documentation page describing the procedure of adding preprocessing to a model.
- Once the documentation is completed and the ResNet model instructions published in the zoo, we will call the mission of this group accomplished and conclude it.
