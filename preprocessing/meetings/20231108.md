## Meeting notes:

### UNet-3D progress

* Liqun Fu has been working on conversion of UNet networks from Monai to ONNX
* convert_to_onnx -> exports MONAI model to ONNX
* Getting support from the team for CI system would help
* Medical imaging workflow consists of 3 stages: preprocessing, inferer, and postprocessing.
* Currently we only have support for the inferer part, excluding the Sliding window inferer.
* A basic model is applied to patches of the image

* Preprocessing:

    - Adjust orientation and spacing
    - Postprocessing usually reverts what was done in preprocessing

* Two operators:

    - AffineGrid -> Generate grid for adjusting orientation & spacing
    - GridSample supporting now 3D

* Needs more time
* Repo keeps changing -> hard to keep track
* What mathematical blocks do we need?

### Open floor

* The ORT teams has a concern regarding adding a dependency with OpenCV
* Most likely will be handled via an ORT extension
* Discussion to be continued next time
