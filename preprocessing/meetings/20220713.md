## Meeting notes:

* Status - Open issues/PRs
    - Resize-18 and CenterCropPad-18 PR were recently merged. It will take ~3 months until they are part of an ONNX/ONNXRuntime release.
    - Still [an open issue](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/10698) related to usage of local functions and graph attributes. Rama will look into it.
    - ResNet models have now arbitrary batch size. There was an issue found with some versions that also include value_infos. More details in [the comments of the PR](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/537). [A new PR](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/542) will also fix value_infos.
    - Documentation doesn't say which is the minimum protobuf version required. There was an issue with protobuf 3.0, which was solved [by this PR](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4354). Joaquin will check with Jacky about the required minimum version.
