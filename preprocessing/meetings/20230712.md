## Meeting notes:

### Status

- [IN PROGRESS] Affine grid generator operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5225
- [IN PROGRESS] Image decoder operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5294
- [IN PROGRESS] StringSplit operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5371
- [IN PROGRESS] StringConcat Operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5350
- [IN PROGRESS] Add RegexFullMatch operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5401

### Image decoder operator proposal

- As discussed during review, the operator has been moved to a separate domain ai.onnx.io
- IO as a name is a little bit vague, but enables future additions for pre and post processing.
- It is not clear for us what implications we want to have when using domains. Are the domains less important compared to core opset? Are those optional?
- The usage of domains shall be discussed further on the Operator SIG tomorrow (July 13, 2023).

### String operators

- Aditya Goel presented three open PRs with string process utils:

* StringSplit operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5371
* StringConcat Operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5350
* Add RegexFullMatch operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5401

- We discussed a standing issue with SpringSplit, about how to represent a variadic number of strings. The two options were to use an extra dimension for the number of strings, which will be padded to the maximum of the batch. Alternatively, we could have a densely packed representation that will use the memory more efficiently, but would be hard to consume. The group agrees to go with the extra dimension + padding approach.

### ParseDateTime

- Christian Bourjau presented a new operator proposal, which was presented during the roadmap meeting, and also discussed in the past.
- https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/5409
- The operator parses a string representation of a date/time to a number of seconds (or other unit). It should behave like UNIX's strptime.
- We discussed the choice of using double for the parsed string, instead of the more natural integer representation. One advantage is that double can represent NaN.
- Christian will check what other Python libraries use for representation and also discuss it further during the ONNX Operators SIG meeting.
