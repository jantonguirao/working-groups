## Meeting notes:

### Status

- ResNet-50 tutorial https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/pull/266
- Waiting for ONNX Runtime support for ONNX opset 18
- ONNX Runtime code freeze will take place this week
- Should cover the needed operators
- Joaquin to give it a test once it gets merged to main

### Resize - flip-invariant

- Current ONNX definition presents a potential problem when using a scale producing an output size with a fractional part that needs to be truncated 
- When this occurs, there's the question on where to place the ROI
- Current ONNX definition places it to the beggining of the input: data=[100, 200], scale=1.3 -> output=[100., 165.38]
- This results in an operation that is not flip-invariant, that is, flipping a dimension before or after the resize operator produces different results.
- Joaquin proposed to add a new coordinate transform mode "half_pixel_symmetric" that retains the relative position of the center of the region in the output.
- "half_pixel_symmetric" will produce flip-invariant results
- The group agrees with such proposal, Joaquin will create a PR

### Open floor

- ONNX runtime will add python scripts to prepend the preprocessing steps to a few of the ONNX zoo models.
- It should be part of the new ONNX runtime release.
- There are few example networks but the user can choose to write their own.
